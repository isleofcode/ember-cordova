#### Building the app

`ember cdv:build` builds the Ember app with Cordova assets injected, and then executes a Cordova build.

```
    ember cdv:build --platform=ios --environment=production
```

ios is the default platform - to change this behaviour see the CLI reference. After building, you will need to deploy to a device or emulator for testing.

##### Release Builds

By default, ember-cordova produces debug builds. You need to add a
`--release` flag for Cordova release builds, see the [cli
reference](pages/cli) for more details.

##### Obtaining provisioning profile UUID for signing iOS

When signing while building as described [here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html#signing-an-app), you can obtain your iOS provisioning profile UUID by downloading it from iTunesConnect and run the following command:
`$ grep -a -A 1 'UUID' /Users/me/Downloads/myapp_dev.mobileprovision`

#### Deploying to a device or emulator

After building the app, you can deploy to a device or emulator using `ember cdv run`, like so:

```bash
  ember cdv run ios --emulator --nobuild   # Deploy to iOS simulator
  ember cdv run android --device --nobuild  # Deploy to Android device
```

Alternatively `ember cdv:open` will open your project in Xcode or Android Studio. The IDE can then be used for starting emulators, code signing & app store uploads.

To deploy to an iOS device, you must have Provisioning Profiles set up. Usually, Xcode can set up development profiles for you automatically.

#### Debugging

Android Builds can be remotely inspected in Chrome ([details](http://geeklearning.io/apache-cordova-and-remote-debugging-on-android/)), and iOS builds in Safari ([details](http://geeklearning.io/apache-cordova-and-remote-debugging-on-ios/)).

#### Non-Cordova Builds

Cordova Assets & plugins will only be injected to `ember cdv:build/serve` tasks. Therefore, builds using `ember build` will not include Cordova assets and will be valid for web. The only service injected by default is [the platform service](/pages/service_platform).
